- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual)

  - Hours per Task Average and Standard Deviation:

    - For **Estimated** Hours:
      - Average Estimate: 1h 37m
      - Standard Deviation Estimate: 2h 46m

    - For **Actual** Hours:
      - Average Actual: 2h 7m
      - Standard Deviation Actual: 3h 8m

- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1 --> 82.5/107 - 1 = -0.23


## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated --> 6h
  - Total hours spent --> 10h
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated --> 4h
  - Total hours spent --> 4h
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated --> 8h
  - Total hours spent --> 6h
  

## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

  - The primary issues were about the estimated time for organizing the front-end part and also to configure the SAML authentication because we encountered limitations as it only supports AUTH0 as an Identity Provider (IDP).
  - Other minor challenges involved gaining familiarity with certain technologies, such as the Virtual Clock and achieving an average experience with certain tools related to testing (both unit and E2E testing).

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

  > positive
  - We learned how to split tasks among the different members of the group and how to communicate more efficiently and effectively.

  > negative
  - We underestimated the difficulties and overall effort required when assigning only one team member to handle the development of the front-end part. 

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  
  - The main goal we set in the previous sprint was to improve our internal communication, coordination and overall team engagement and we were able to achieve it.

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

  - We need to prioritize enhancing the responsiveness of the Thesis Management application to ensure its usability on various devices, including smartphones and tablets. 

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!

  - We are proud that we were able to overcome the initial difficulties and to set a positive environment for every team member in which everyone could work in the best and most effective way.
