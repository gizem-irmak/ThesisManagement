## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- 6 stories committed | 1 stories done 
- 8 points committed | 1 points done 
- 96h | 38h 50m spent (as a team)

### Detailed statistics

| Story | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
| ----- | ------- | ------ | ---------- | ------------ |
| _#0_  | 16      |        | 25h        | 20h 30m      |
| n 1   | 3       | 13     | 6h         | 10h          |
| n 2   | 3       | 5      | 6h         | 10h 30m      |
| n 3   | 3       | 8      | 3h         | ?            |
| n 4   | 3       | 3      | 4h         | ?            |
| n 5   | 3       | 2      | 2h         | ?            |
| n 6   | 3       | 1      | 4h         | ?            |


- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual)

  - Hours per Task Average and Standard Deviation:

  - For Estimated Hours:
      - Average Estimate: 7.14h
      - Standard Deviation Estimate: 5.21h

    - For Actual Hours:
      - Average Actual: 5.86h
      - Standard Deviation Actual: 7.51h

- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1 --> 25/20.5 -1 = 0.22


## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated --> 9h
  - Total hours spent --> 1h
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated --> 2h
  - Total hours spent --> 2h
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated --> 3h
  - Total hours spent --> 3h
  

## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

  - The primary issues were about the estimated time for organizing the team in each task. This implied the need for multiple members to intervene on specific parts made by someone else in order to solve the problems
  - Another error was assigning some tasks without effectively considering the individual's skills, leading to general problems on that specific task.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

  > positive
  - We learned that it's needed to split the work in a different way, in order to improve the performances and the individual skills of each of us.
  - We learned more deeper the capabilities of each team member. 

  > negative
  - We underestimated the difficulties and overall effort required when assigning the team member to handle the development of a task that is not in his skills.
  - We underestimated the importance of communicate and organize multiple meetings in order to keep everyone updated. 

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  
  - The team identified and recognized gaps in skills or processes, paving the way for targeted interventions and improvements.

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

  - With the aim of significantly improving group work it is necessary to focus on some areas:
    - communication (greater communication is needed both in chat and through meetings)
    - division of labor effectively according to each person's abilities
    - improve the quality of work (it is necessary to improve the quality of work to achieve the set objectives)
    - awareness of one's own abilities (everyone should be aware of their own abilities so that they can ask colleagues for help with any difficulties) 

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!

  - we are proud as a team to have gained a greater awareness of the skills needed, recognizing strengths and identifying areas where improvement may be needed.
